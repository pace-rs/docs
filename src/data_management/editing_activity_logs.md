# Editing Activity Logs

`pace` currently doesn't provide a lot of commands for editing activity logs.
However, you can edit the activity log file directly using a text editor. The
activity log file is named `activities.pace.toml` and stored in the TOML format.
Please refer to the
[Activity Log Storage](./activity_log_storage.md#storage-format) document for
more information about the storage format and location of the activity log file.

**NOTE**: The plan is to provide a web-interface, synchronization with cloud
storage, and a mobile and desktop application for managing activity logs, tasks
and even projects in the future. So it is unlikely, that we will provide a lot
of commands for editing activity logs in the command line interface.
