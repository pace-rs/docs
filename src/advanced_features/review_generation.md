options to customize the output. For example, you can specify the time period,
format, and other settings. The generated review can be saved to a file or
printed to the console.

You can customize the appearance and content of the generated review by using
templates. Templates are written in a simple markup language that allows you to
specify the structure and formatting of the output. You can create your own
templates or use predefined ones.

pace uses the [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera) template engine, which
provides a powerful and flexible way to create templates. You can use variables,
loops, conditionals, and other features to control the content and appearance of
the output. You can also use filters and functions to transform and format the
data. It is inspired by [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) and
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) templates.
