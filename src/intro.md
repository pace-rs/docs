# Introduction

`pace` is a mindful productivity tool designed to help you keep track of your activities with ease and intention.

Born from the desire to blend simplicity with effectiveness, pace offers a command-line interface (CLI) that encourages focused work sessions, thoughtful reflection on task durations, and a harmonious balance between work and rest.

Whether you're a developer, a writer, or anyone who values structured time management, pace provides the framework to log activities, review progress, and optimize how you spend your time.

With features like the first activity wizard for onboarding new users, real-time configuration validation (upcoming), and personalized activity logs, pace is more than a time tracker â€” it's your partner in crafting a productive and mindful routine.
